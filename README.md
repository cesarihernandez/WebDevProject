# CS5610_GroupProject
Final Project

Our group has contributed to creating REACT.js frontend and have connected to our backend. We created 
a simple design that we build off of and to alter some of the frontend capabilities. We were able to display our data to
our frontend which confirmed our frontend and backend were communicating locally and through google deploy. We added search and a dropdown functionality as well.

One issue we are having is having images of our dogs populate in our frontend. We get a 400 error code so we know it is coming from the backend. We will look to have this fixed by the next iteration. This was not so much of an issue but 
having confidence in using the command line to pull and push code to the repo. Luckily we had a memeber of the group 
who was able to troubleshoot and github issues.

We hope to break off from the original frontend display we have currently and make it more of our own. We used what we have as a bench mark to ensure we had a solid foundation to work off of. Our design and search functionalities will imporove as well.
