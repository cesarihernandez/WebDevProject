# CS5610_GroupProject

Final Project

## Iteration 1

Our group has contributed to creating REACT.js frontend and have connected to our backend. We created
a simple design that we build off of and to alter some of the frontend capabilities. We were able to display our data to
our frontend which confirmed our frontend and backend were communicating locally and through google deploy. We added search and a dropdown functionality as well.

One issue we are having is having images of our dogs populate in our frontend. We get a 400 error code so we know it is coming from the backend. We will look to have this fixed by the next iteration. This was not so much of an issue but
having confidence in using the command line to pull and push code to the repo. Luckily we had a memeber of the group
who was able to troubleshoot and github issues.

We hope to break off from the original frontend display we have currently and make it more of our own. We used what we have as a bench mark to ensure we had a solid foundation to work off of. Our design and search functionalities will imporove as well.

## Iteration 2

Since iteration 1, we have made a lot of progress. We have successfully loaded the dog images to the web page. We have also added functionality for users to mark their favorite dogs which persists through logouts and page refreshes. We fixed an issue with filtering dogs by size and now the user can filter by size using the drop down menu and pressing the search bar. Further, we have added functionality for adding, updating, and deleting reviews. Lastly, we implemented a favorites page which allows the user to view all of their favorited dogs.

Moving forward, we still need to address searching by specific dog breed, exploring different CSS formating, and adding some react components to make the website more engaging for the user.

## Iteration 3

Since iteration 2 and this being our final iteration we have achieved full functionality for iteration 3. This includes having our search by breed functionality working. This required some refactoring and making sure search indexes were set up on Mongo Atlas DB instance. We wanted to add more functionality so we created an image carousel component to allow the user to see general dog sizing with a four different pictures displaying weight ranges when clicking on a breed at landing page. We also wanted to make some stylistic changes to change font size/type for certain text, landing background and we worked on positioning certain components for a better overall user experience.
